  "long_description": "# ssh-hardening (Chef cookbook)\n\n## Description\n\nThis cookbook provides secure ssh-client and ssh-server configurations.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Opscode chef\n\n## Attributes\n\n* `['network']['ipv6']['enable']` - true if IPv6 is needed\n* `['ssh']['cbc_required']` - true if CBC for ciphers is required. This is usually only necessary, if older M2M mechanism need to communicate with SSH, that don't have any of the configured secure ciphers enabled. CBC is a weak alternative. Anything weaker should be avoided and is thus not available.\n* `['ssh']['weak_hmac']` - true if weaker HMAC mechanisms are required. This is usually only necessary, if older M2M mechanism need to communicate with SSH, that don't have any of the configured secure HMACs enabled. \n* `['ssh']['weak_kex']` - true if weaker Key-Exchange (KEX) mechanisms are required. This is usually only necessary, if older M2M mechanism need to communicate with SSH, that don't have any of the configured secure KEXs enabled.\n* `['ssh']['allow_root_with_key']` - `false` to disable root login altogether. Set to `true` to allow root to login via key-based mechanism.\n* `['ssh']['ports']` - ports to which ssh-server should listen to and ssh-client should connect to\n* `['ssh']['listen_to']` - one or more ip addresses, to which ssh-server should listen to. Default is empty, but should be configured for security reasons!\n* `['ssh']['remote_hosts']` - one or more hosts, to which ssh-client can connect to. Default is empty, but should be configured for security reasons!\n* `['ssh']['allow_tcp_forwarding']` - `false` to disable TCP Forwarding. Set to `true` to allow TCP Forwarding\n* `['ssh']['allow_agent_forwarding']` - `false` to disable Agent Forwarding. Set to `true` to allow Agent Forwarding\n\n## Data Bags\n\nThis cookbook handles authorized keys for the root user. Use other cookbooks to set up your users.\n\nHave users in your `data_bag/users/` directory. This cookbook looks for users inside this folder with a `ssh_rootkey`.\n\nExample: \n\nFirst you have to find out the ssh-key of the user you want to allow. A typical example for this is\n\n    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nIf that folder doesn't exist or you don't know what this is all about, please read a SSH tutorial for your blend of operating system first.\n\nYou can now add this key to the data bag. Example for dada:\n\nExample for `data_bags/users/dada.json`\n\n    {\n      \"id\" : \"dada\",\n      // ... other stuff ...\n      \"ssh_rootkey\" : \"ssh-rsa AAAA....mail.com\"\n    }\n\nYou can then access\n\n    ssh dada@yourmachines\n\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd the recipes to the run_list:\n    \n    \"recipe[ssh]\"\n\nThis will install ssh-server and ssh-client. You can alternatively choose only one via:\n\n    \"recipe[ssh::server]\"\n    \"recipe[ssh::client]\"\n\nConfigure attributes:\n\n    \"ssh\" : {\n      \"listen_to\" : \"10.2.3.4\"\n    }\n\n**The default value for `listen_to` is `0.0.0.0`. It is highly recommended to change the value.**\n\n## Local Testing\n\nFor local testing you can use vagrant and Virtualbox of VMWare to run tests locally. You will have to install Virtualbox and Vagrant on your system. See [Vagrant Downloads](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/) for a vagrant package suitable for your system. For all our tests we use `test-kitchen`. If you are not familiar with `test-kitchen` please have a look at [their guide](http://kitchen.ci/docs/getting-started).\n\nNext install test-kitchen:\n\n```bash\ngem install bundler\nbundle install\n\n# Do lint checks\nbundle exec rake lint\n\n# Fetch tests\nthor kitchen:fetch-remote-tests\n\n# Kitchen test\nbundle exec kitchen list\nbundle exec kitchen test default-ubuntu-1204\n```\n\nFor more information see [test-kitchen](http://kitchen.ci/docs/getting-started)\n\n## Contributors + Kudos\n\n* Dominik Richter\n* Christoph Hartmann\n* Patrick Meier\n* Bernhard K.
